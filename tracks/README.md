# Demonstration LSTF Tracks

The files in this directory are generated by `scripts/generate_demo_lstf_tracks.py`
and showcase different features of the Light Show Track Format (LSTF) parser and
player. Every track contains dedicated timelines for the centre, left, and right
pads and runs for between five and fifteen seconds. Each `.lstf` file uses the
text transport wrapper (`LSTF-TEXT 1` plus base64 payload) so the binary chunk
stream can be stored safely in version control.

| File | Highlighted feature |
| --- | --- |
| `aurora_glide.lstf` | Cascading palette fades that reuse the per-track default transition. |
| `rainbow_cycle.lstf` | Literal RGB fades with overlapping ramps on all three pads. |
| `sync_pulse.lstf` | Synchronous pulse sequences using `FlashColour` with varying tempos. |
| `triple_chase.lstf` | Sequential chase pattern that rotates the active pad. |
| `tempo_ramp.lstf` | Tempo changes that accelerate the perceived flashing speed. |
| `countdown_burst.lstf` | Countdown pulses with shrinking on/off windows. |
| `strobe_warning.lstf` | High-intensity strobes followed by a blackout. |
| `twinkle_field.lstf` | Asynchronous twinkles with short dwell times for each pad. |
| `wave_cascade.lstf` | Layered wave fades offset between pads. |
| `centre_stage.lstf` | Centre spotlight backed by supportive side pulses. |
| `ocean_swell.lstf` | Slow, overlapping fades that collapse into a blackout. |
| `fireworks_finale.lstf` | Palette overrides with sparkling bursts and finale strobe. |
